# Algo Visualizer

Welcome to the **Algo Visualizer** project! This tool helps you understand various algorithms by visualizing their execution. Explore time complexity, space complexity, and sorting algorithms through interactive and educational visuals.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms Visualization**: See how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step.
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Understand how the runtime of algorithms grows with input size.
- **Space Complexity Analysis**: Visualize the memory usage of algorithms during execution.
- **Interactive Controls**: Customize speed, input size, and algorithm parameters to explore different scenarios.

## Installation

To get started with Algo Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsItRobin/algorithm-visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd algorithm-visualizer
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   If your project uses a build tool or package manager, install the necessary dependencies. For example, if using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   To start the visualizer, run the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.AlgoVisualizer"
   ```

   Replace `com.example.AlgoVisualizer` with the main class of your project.

## Usage

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose from various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
2. **Customize Parameters**: Adjust the input size and other parameters to see how they affect the algorithmâ€™s performance.
3. **Visualize Execution**: Watch the algorithm execute step-by-step, with animations showing how data is manipulated.
4. **Analyze Complexity**: View real-time graphs and metrics related to time and space complexity.
